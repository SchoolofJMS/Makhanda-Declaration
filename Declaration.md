# The Makhanda Declaration
## Preamble
The Rhodes University Journalism Summit 2024, with its theme “Seeds of change; cultivating the future of journalism in Africa”, deliberated for three days on the evolving life of journalism in the digital era.


The summit reiterated that journalism is a form of communication with a particular ethos oriented towards citizen empowerment, the transparency and accountability of power (both public and private) and the building of democracy.


The summit believes that it is important to provide all people with accurate information to address past injustices and restore dignity and empowerment to citizens. We believe that Journalism is essential in fulfilling this duty.


The summit recognised that in addressing the dehumanisation of the past, part of redress is that access to credible, verifiable information is necessary for the dignity and agency of citizens, we believe that Journalism still has a fundamental role to play in this constitutional obligation.


Therefore, the summit drew a declaration covering the life and changing times of journalism and declared the following;
## 1. Journalism as a Public Good
We believe journalism and news in particular, is a public good and human right. We believe that journalism is a set of practices, values and ethics of society, which includes government, business and civil society, which we must invest in.  Journalism has a future in the digital age and we believe it is central to democracy,  sustainable development  and the public good. We demand that access to news and journalism be recognised as a fundamental right.



## 2. Internet Access
Internet access is a public good and human right. We stand against digital inequality and injustice. Internet access must be universal. Data costs must be accessible to all citizens. Government, legislatures, and regulators must act now to ensure that data prices are fair.        
South African citizens need affordable access to the internet. It is imperative that the internet be considered a public good, and the control of access and the setting of prices be removed from the private companies who control this access.


We call for transparency of algorithms and we demand explainable AI. We recognise that algorithms and platform terms and conditions vary according to geolocation and therefore we call on the African Union to assist in the documentation and the study of a continental understanding of these platform logics. We encourage newsrooms to develop beats around algorithmic abuse and unfettered data mining.


## 3. Sustainability of Journalism 
We believe in the constitutional principles which support a sustainable media ecosystem in which credible news journalism can serve the needs of a democratic South Africa and its citizens. We affirm our commitment to regulation, sustainability and the future of the media. We encourage innovation in the quest for new funding models in order to ensure that media is sustainable in the digital era. Sustainability should extend to:


● Fair compensation for credible media organisations[3] and journalists through the taxation of big tech and online platforms. Fair compensation for news should be based on the value the platforms derive from the content, channelling tax revenue through an independently governed funding entity for public interest media.


●  Developing a Public Interest Journalism fund with multiple sources of revenue


## 4. Taxation of big tech
We believe it is time to establish a fair taxation standard for digital platforms in South Africa and on the African continent. We call for the formation of a multi-stakeholder body to work out the modalities and structure of a fair digital economy tax. Further we call on the African Union to require member states to adhere to a set of guidelines on fair taxation of digital platforms in the public interest. We require that at least 20% of taxes raised in this way should be dedicated to a public media fund that supports the strengthening of indigenous language media in this country, which includes research.


## 5. Community media 
We believe that community media plays a crucial role in enabling a plurality of voices in our society. It also plays a role in building a civil society that can hold the powerful to account at all levels of society. It plays a particular role in our country particularly in relation to building social cohesion. We call for increased direct funding.
6. Multilingualism  
We believe in a culture of multilingualism. We believe that African indigenous languages give us insight into all these cultural worlds and are part of the unique wealth of our continent. We endorse section 6 of the SA Constitution that implores all public bodies to support all marginalised and endangered indigenous languages. We resolve to hold accountable the Public Broadcaster, which has a mandate of language preservation and PANSALB to implement its language mandate. We commit ourselves to the growth of media in indigenous languages and to multilingualism in general.


## 7. Public broadcasting
It is imperative that the public broadcaster with its television channels and radio stations in indigenous languages be properly managed, accountable to a functioning parliamentary committee, and properly funded by the taxes of South Africans.
Responding to the need for broadcast and public broadcasting regulation and policy, which is severely outdated. There is a need to review and update the legislation on broadcast to support and respond to the evolving electronic, digital and online environment.


## 8. Education
We need to nurture the journalists of the future. This includes journalists in schools and student journalists in higher education. We believe that student journalists are journalists. We call for basic education and higher education policy to recognise and protect this and for universities to develop policy that explicitly protects student journalists to do the work they are supposed to do. As journalism teachers we commit to support campaigns to support the student media and to the development of journalism in schools.         


We affirm the role and value of our journalism trainers and education organisations  to develop a new generation of principled and ethical journalists and media creators. We need to recognise the role of these trainers and organisations. We are working  in an ever changing environment and that requires us to be in constant conversation and in support of each other. We will work towards the establishment of a network to share knowledge and ideas towards the invention and constant development of a relevant and sustainable curriculum and a future for our young people within the profession. We need our journalism industry leaders and government agencies  to commit to supporting journalism education institutions. This by assisting with the placement of students. We hope to work together to theorise the media space and engage SETAs around providing adequate funding to train the new generation of journalists.


## 9. Regulation
We value regulation in the public interest, which upholds freedoms of expression and is developed through deliberative participation, emerging through the relevant, fair and transparent legislation processes. We commit to regulation in the digital age to support the regulation and monitoring of converged media and its distribution on online platforms. Self-regulatory bodies should consider a joint approach to ethical codes of conduct to support credible journalism production across all media for online, digital, print, broadcast and internet technologies. We call for specific focus on platform regulation and on internet platforms and their regulatory oversight, which is needed. 


## 10. Attacks on and killing  journalists
 We decry the deaths and attacks of hundreds of journalists that have been witnessed in the last two years.We believe that given the role that journalists play in democracy, the public and the private sector and the state have a duty of care to ensure the safety and wellbeing of journalists. Journalists suffer a great deal of trauma because of their exposure to human tragedy, war and conflict. Attacks on journalists have also increased, including jailings, killings and digital harassment. We call on governments and the AU  
1) To create a mechanism/authority that is responsible for the protection of journalists in each state, and  
2) We call for the release of all journalists held in jail on our continent. 
We call on academic institutions to collaborate on curricula that highlight coverage of violence, war and social conflict that are trauma aware and that prepare journalists for the contexts in which they will be reporting.  
We encourage the adoption of the Ghanaian Model.


## 11. Student media
We believe in the historical value of the student media  and we call on university authorities to respect its independence. All rights that apply to the media should apply to the student press. We call on universities, the private sector and the government to ensure funding to ensure their survival. We call for the establishment of an independent national student press council. And that adequate funds are made available for the sustainability thereof. We encourage school and student journalists to adopt the press code and the code of ethics. We call all institutions and places of learning to ensure policy that protects journalistic work. 
In conclusion:
We are committed to the survival and thriving of journalism and its contribution to democracy and its value to society.  
We recognise that the mediasphere is complex, multifaceted, and diffused and that journalism supports many forms of communications for a multiplicity of purposes. 
We call on civil society, educators, big tech companies, the government and society at large to recognize that journalism will always be relevant and the truth will never be obsolete, and that journalism will always be of paramount importance regardless of the publishing platform, be that print, broadcast, digital or otherwise. 
The dissemination of news must recognise partnerships and collaboration.
We must work together to protect journalism’s value to society.
